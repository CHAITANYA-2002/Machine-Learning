## 🏡 California House Price Predictor
The **California House Price Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on the California housing dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using regression algorithms.

### 📌 Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Training models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and R² score
