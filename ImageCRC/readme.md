# ImageCRC

Welcome to the **ImageCRC** project! This project focuses on **image compression and reconstruction** using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It aims to reduce image storage requirements while maintaining high-quality reconstruction.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
ImageCRC is designed to provide efficient compression of images using neural networks, reducing storage space while ensuring minimal loss of visual information. It leverages deep learning architectures, including autoencoders and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to achieve effective encoding and decoding of image data.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Rescaling, normalization, and data augmentation for improved model performance.
- **Compression Techniques**:
  - Autoencoders for unsupervised learning-based compression.
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
  - Traditional image compression algorithms for comparison.
- **Reconstruction Methods**:
  - Deep learning models such as CNNs and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for high-quality image reconstruction.
  - Lossy and lossless reconstruction approaches.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** to measure reconstruction fidelity.
  - **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** to evaluate image quality.
  - **Compression Ratio Analysis** to assess efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAITANYA-2002/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ImageCRC
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ImageCRC.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project supports multiple datasets, including:
- **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**: Common datasets for training image-based models.
- **Custom Datasets**: Users can provide their own images for testing.
- **OpenCV Image Sources**: Real-time image processing using OpenCV.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Architecture
- **Encoder**: Uses CNN layers to extract image features and encode them into a compressed representation.
- **Latent Space Representation**: A bottleneck layer that stores the compressed image features.
- **Decoder**: Uses upsampling layers to reconstruct the original image from compressed features.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for model training.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures image fidelity post-reconstruction.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Assesses perceptual image quality.
- **Compression Ratio (CR)**: Evaluates the effectiveness of the compression model.
