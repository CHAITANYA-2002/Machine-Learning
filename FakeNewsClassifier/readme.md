# Fake News Classifier

Welcome to the **Fake News Classifier**! This project implements a machine learning model to detect and classify fake news articles based on textual data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Fake News Classifier leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between fake and real news. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to enhance classification accuracy.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- Data preprocessing (removing stop words, stemming, and tokenization)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Training classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
```

### Steps to Run
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd FakeNewsClassifier
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fake_News_Classifier.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles with a target variable indicating whether the news is real or fake. It has been preprocessed for training and testing purposes.
