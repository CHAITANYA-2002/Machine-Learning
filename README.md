# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Projects Repository**! This repository contains a diverse set of machine learning and data science projects aimed at solving real-world problems. From predictive analytics to image classification and NLP, each project demonstrates key concepts in machine learning using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## 📌 Overview
Machine Learning (ML) enables systems to learn from data and make informed decisions without explicit programming. The projects in this repository cover different ML paradigms, including:
- **Supervised Learning** (Regression & Classification)
- **Unsupervised Learning** (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction)
- **Deep Learning** (CNNs & LSTMs)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

Each project includes well-documented notebooks and scripts that demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
