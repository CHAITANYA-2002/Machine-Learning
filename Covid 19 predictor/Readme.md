# Covid-19 Predictor

Welcome to the **Covid-19 Predictor**! This project implements a machine learning model to predict Covid-19 cases based on available dataset features.

## 📌 Overview
The Covid-19 Predictor utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to estimate infection trends. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to enhance predictive accuracy.

## 📂 Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.)
- Model evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
