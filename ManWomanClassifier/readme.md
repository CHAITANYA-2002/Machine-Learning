# Man-Woman Classifier

Welcome to the **Man-Woman Classifier** project! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images of men and women based on facial features.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Man-Woman Classifier is designed to automatically detect and classify gender from facial images. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features and make predictions with high accuracy.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- **Image preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN-based classifier trained on a labeled dataset
- **Real-time prediction**: Supports webcam-based classification
- **Performance evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAITANYA-2002/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ManWomanClassifier
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Man_Woman_Classifier.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of male and female facial images. The dataset is preprocessed to enhance training efficiency and accuracy.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **Pooling layers** to reduce spatial dimensions
- **Fully connected layers** for classification
- **Softmax activation function** for gender classification

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates class-wise performance
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of model predictions
